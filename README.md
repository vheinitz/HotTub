Hot Tub
--------


Hot Tub is a templating project for CouchDB.  It's designed to make editing documents very easy.  When you open a document for the first time in Hot Tub, a template
is automatically generated for it based on the structure of the JSON.  You can make changes to the template and Hot Tub will save it for you (templates are associated with
views)

Building
--------

Hot Tub is based on Qt.  If you do not have the Qt SDK available on your system, you must get it first, then:

qmake
make  (nmake for Windows)


Enjoy!

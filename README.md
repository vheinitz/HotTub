Hot Tub
--------


Hot Tub is a project designed to provide templates for CouchDB documents.  It's designed to make editing documents very easy.  
When you open a document for the first time in Hot Tub, a template is automatically generated for it based on the structure of the JSON.  
You can make changes to the template and Hot Tub will save it for you (templates are associated with views).

Hot Tub also features drag and drop attachments, paging for views, and many other features.

Building
--------

Hot Tub is based on Qt.  If you do not have the Qt SDK available on your system, you must get it first, then:

    1. qmake
    2. make  (nmake for Windows)


Enjoy!
